# 📰 Headline Generation for Hindi News Articles using IndicBART and LoRA

This project implements an automatic Hindi headline generation system using transformer-based architectures — primarily **IndicBART-XLSum**. Two fine-tuning approaches are explored:
- **Standard Fine-Tuning** of the full model
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning** using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**

The project shows that LoRA achieves comparable performance while significantly reducing memory usage and training time — a practical solution for low-resource NLP environments.

## 📘 Project Overview

In low-resource NLP environments like Hindi, full fine-tuning of large transformer models can be impractical. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of **LoRA** for headline generation using:
- **IndicBART-XLSum (Standard)**: Full fine-tuning.
- **IndicBART-XLSum with LoRA**: Only trainable low-rank matrices are updated.

Both models were evaluated using ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore.

- All weights updated
- More compute-intensive

### 2. IndicBART + LoRA
- Frozen base model
- LoRA injected into attention layers
- Lightweight and modular

---

## 🏋️ Training & Evaluation

- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers + PEFT (LoRA support)
- **Loss**: CrossEntropy
- **Tokenizer**: IndicBART SentencePiece
- **Max Input Length**: 512
- **Max Output Length**: 32

### Evaluation Metrics:
- ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L
- BLEU
- METEOR
- BERTScore

## 📊 Results

| Metric      | IndicBART (Standard) | IndicBART (LoRA) |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------|
| ROUGE-1     | 0.493                | 0.423            |
| ROUGE-2     | 0.324                | 0.124            |
| ROUGE-L     | 0.519                | 0.429            |
| BLEU        | 0.158                | 0.118            |
| METEOR      | 0.288                | 0.242            |
| BERTScore   | 0.756                | 0.676            |

🟢 **LoRA saves ~50% GPU memory and halves training time** while achieving competitive results.
